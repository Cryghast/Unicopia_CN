 
  Corruption:
     Corruption is gained in small amounts by using dark magic and has the effects described by wearing the alicorn amulet
     Using light magic has the potential to reduce a player's corruption
     
     - Increasing corruption should corrupt spell's effects (higher chance of failing)
     - Visual effects of corruption is a greyscale darkening of the player's view
     - Players and spells with high corruption "leak" in to the surrounding areas
        and corrupts other spells in the vicinity causing them to fail or turn against the caster
        
     - Areas with high corruption will see higher hostile mob spawns
       Chances of blocks being turned into sculk when corruption is gained in an area
       
       
     - Certain spells cannot be used above a certain corruption threshold
     - Other spells (from the otherworldly category) cannot be used without a minimum amount of corruption
  
  
  Lighting
   - Gemstone Lamp
      - A light source similar to torches
        - Can be placed on clouds

    - Immobalise
      Offensive
      Trap the targetted entity in a floating bubble.
      They have to struggle to pop the bubble and escape
  
    - Dark Whip
        Offense
        A dark magic spell that lashes out at a position or entity with a black tendril
        - Needs corruption to cast
        
        To craft this one you have to defeat the Rift Lurker
        - Throw a alicorn amulet into a large black hole
        - The black hole's lightning effects change to black lightning
        - The black hole collapses into a small ball
        - The ball turns into an eye and tentacles crawl out revealing the Rift Lurker (an other-worldly beast from across the dimensions)
        - Whilst fighting the Rift Lurker the black hole is still pulling in entities
        - Every entity that falls into the black hole restores the rift lurker's health
        - Every time you summon it, the rift lurker will be more powerful
        
        - The rift-lurker can only be defeated using magic
        - When killed, the rift-lurker drops one of its tentacles
        - Combine the tentacle in a spellbook with the blood, focus, and life traits to create the dark whip spell
  
      - To avoid having to fight the Rift Lurker every time, you can farm the tentacles
      - Tentacles are edible, like carrots, but why would you eat them? Ew.
  
   - Dark Grip
      - Corrupt version of the Arcane Grip
         - Causes damage to living entities affected
      - Requires corruption to cast
  
   - Come to life spell
     - Requires corruption to cast
     - Used on any container block (chest, furnace, etc) will cause it to grow legs and follow the player around
     - With the darkness trait will add a chance of the block also obtaining a mouth and attacking the caster
     -----Player's corruption increases chances of any spells going wrong (increases darkness trait effects)
